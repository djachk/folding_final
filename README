We tried to compare Material Point Method (MPM, using Taichi package to accelerate execution) to Finite Element Method (FEM) as a simulation tool to model continuum materials from a mechanical point of view.

This is the content of the directories:

Comment_mpm-99:
This simple program written by the Ta√Øchi team implements MPM.

Comparison_beam_MPM_Abaqus_FreeFem:
We compare three modeling methods on a simple beam configuration: MPM, FreeFem (FEM) and Abaqus (FEM).
The files with extension .res or .temoin are data files produced for various values of E, nu and g.
The notebook reads the data files and plots the results.

Comparison_box_MPM_Abaqus:
The same thing is done with MPM and Abaqus only, for a box-shaped object.

Cortical_folding:
Cortex folding is simulated with MPM and results are compared to those obtained in the original article from P V Bayley and al. 

Optimal_density_of_particles:
Several densities of particles are used to model using MPM the dynamics of a box-shaped object supporting its own weight.
The minimum density to reach asymptotic steady state is deduced.
